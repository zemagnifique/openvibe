# Openvibe

Welcome to Openvibe — a chaotic, open-source game dev experiment. Build a game with no communication, just pure vibes. Anyone from the vibe coding community can contribute. Let’s see what happens.

## Rules
1. **No Communication**: No chatting, commenting, or coordinating with others. Your code and commits are your voice.
2. **Don’t Delete the GitHub Link**: Keep the link to this repo intact in the project (e.g., in credits or a text file).
3. **One Open Pull Request Per Person**: Submit one PR with your contribution—big or small—and that’s it.
4. **Stick to the Engine**: Use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) as the base. Don’t overhaul the core framework.
5. **Keep It Open**: All contributions must stay open-source under the MIT License.
6. **Merge Rule**: PRs are merged in the order they’re received, as long as they work (no crashes or broken builds). First come, first merged.

## How to Contribute
- Fork the repo.
- Add your piece—code, assets, whatever fits—using Three.js.
- Update the [Credits](#credits) section below with your name and social link (optional).
- Submit a pull request by TBD.
- Watch the chaos unfold.

## What’s the Goal?
There isn’t one. It’s an experiment. Playable game? Total mess? Either way, it’s ours.

## Credits
Add your name and social link (e.g., Twitter, GitHub, personal site) here when you contribute. Format it like this:
- [Your Name] - [Your Link]

Example:
- [VibeCoder] - [https://github.com/vibecoder]
